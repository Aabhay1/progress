# This day I learned:

- The 7 layers of the OSI(open system interconnection) Model:
  1. Application
  2. Presentation
  3. Session
  4. Transport
  5. Network
  6. Data Link
  7. Physical

##  Questions I had today:

- Why does OSI have 7 layers and not fewer?
- What is the use of osi model?
---

## What I understood better:

- OSI is a **conceptual model**, not used as-is in real networking.
- It helps in **understanding where protocols and attacks occur**.
