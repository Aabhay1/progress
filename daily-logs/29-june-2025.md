###  Topic: Security Operations Center (SOC) — Roles and Hierarchy

#### What I Learned Today:

* Studied the structure of a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** and understood the layered roles:

  * **Tier 1 Analyst** – First line of defense, alert monitoring.
  * **Tier 2 Analyst** – Handles escalated incidents, root cause analysis.
  * **Tier 3 / Threat Hunter** – Identifies hidden threats, reverse engineering.
  * **SOC Manager** – Manages people, processes, and tools.
  * **Security Engineer** – Sets up detection tools, automation.
  * **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)** – Leads strategy, governance, risk.

###  Questions + Answers:

#### What skills does a Tier 1 SOC Analyst need?

**Technical Skills:**

* Basic knowledge of networking (TCP/IP, ports, protocols).
* Familiarity with security tools like SIEM (e.g., Splunk, QRadar, AlienVault).
* Understanding of operating systems (Windows/Linux).
* Basic log analysis skills (reading syslogs, firewall logs, event logs).
* Knowledge of malware types, phishing, brute-force attacks, etc.

**Soft Skills:**

* Analytical thinking.
* Attention to detail.
* Communication (for reporting incidents).
* Time management (since SOCs are often fast-paced).

#### What are the responsibilities of a Tier 1 SOC Analyst?

* Monitor dashboards and SIEM alerts for suspicious activities.
* Triage and prioritize incidents based on severity.
* Document findings and escalate complex cases to Tier 2.
* Run basic investigations (IP reputation check, log review).
* Create and update incident tickets.
* Follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) for incident handling.

#### What tools do Tier 1 Analysts commonly use?

* **SIEM Tools:** Splunk, IBM QRadar, Elastic SIEM, LogRhythm.
* **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** CrowdStrike, SentinelOne.
* **Ticketing Systems:** ServiceNow, Jira, Remedy.
* **Threat Intel Tools:** VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX.
* **Basic scripting tools:** Sometimes Python/bash for automation.

#### What is the career path from Tier 1 to higher SOC roles?

1. **Tier 1 Analyst** (Entry level)
2. **Tier 2 Analyst** (More experienced, deeper investigation)
3. **Tier 3 / Threat Hunter / Incident Responder**
4. **SOC Manager / Blue Team Lead**
5. **Security Engineer / Architect**
6. **CISO / Cybersecurity Director**

#### What certifications are useful for Tier 1 roles?

* **CompTIA Security+** – foundational cert.
* **Certified SOC Analyst (CSA)** – specifically for SOC roles.
* **EC-Council’s CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** – basics of hacking and defense.
* **Cisco CyberOps Associate** – entry-level SOC cert.
* **Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)** – practical skills in monitoring and detection.

###  Insights:

* Tier 1 is the best entry point into the cyber world — it builds alertness, foundational skills, and teamwork.
* Having basic scripting (Python/bash) and understanding of logs can give an edge.
* Certifications are helpful, but hands-on lab practice is even more valuable.

###  Next Steps:

* Try open-source SOC labs like **BlueTeamLabs Online** or **TryHackMe (SOC Path)**.
* Set up a basic **ELK stack** to practice log monitoring.
* Work on understanding **MITRE ATT\&CK framework** – it’s widely used in SOCs.
